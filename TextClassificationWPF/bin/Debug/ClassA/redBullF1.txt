Red Bull and the F1 budget cap: What have they done wrong and what happens next?
Red Bull have breached the 2021 budget cap - but what costs are included in the cap and what penalty could be handed their way?

It is the story which everyone in F1 is talking about: Red Bull have been found guilty of breaching the 2021 cost cap.

We now await a punishment from the FIA - but what have Red Bull done wrong? Why was the cost cap introduced, what costs are included and what options are now open to Red Bull?

Here’s everything you need to know.

What is the F1 cost cap?
Formula 1’s cost-cap measures were brought in last year to reduce the lavish spending of big teams - sometimes upwards of $400million - in order to narrow the field and increase the competitiveness of the championship, enabling smaller teams to compete in an even environment.

The other key aspect was to be in keeping with F1’s target of sustainability, with the cap working to limit the amount of money an F1 team can spend in any year to encourage financial-sustainability.

In 2021, the cap was $145m (£114m) - and was originally reduced to $140m this year before an extra allowance of £5m was granted by the FIA due to: the season being 22 races long, the three sprint weekends and rising inflation.

Current plans are for it to be reduced further to £135m for 2023-205 but those figures are not confirmed, especially given the announcement of F1’s record 24-race calendar for 2023, with costs thus increasing for teams.

What is included in the cost cap?
Essentially, the cap covers all expenditure relating to car performance, including:

All parts on the car
All the elements needed to run the car
Most of the team personnel
Garage equipment
Spares
Transport costs of car
What is not included?
Everything not relating to car performance. Specifically:

Driver salaries (Max Verstappen’s reported £40m-a-year salary, for example, would not be included)
The wages of the three highest-paid staff members
Travel costs
Marketing spend
Property and legal costs
Entry and licence fees
Any non-F1 or road car activities
Parental and sick leave payments
Employee bonuses and staff medical benefits
