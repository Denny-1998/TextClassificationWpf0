ARSENAL are in Europa League action RIGHT NOW at Bodo/Glimt in Norway - and Bukayo Saka has put the Gunners ahead.

The Gunners finally broke their Liverpool curse by beating the Reds 3-2 in a mouth-watering contest at the Emirates at the weekend.

However, Mikel Arteta's men will have to readjust their focus on the Europa League with the Norwegian side up now.

But the Gunners should be quietly confident having already brushed Bodo/Glimt aside in the reverse fixture.
