"We also know the team are very special and we have no doubt they’ll do everything to maintain their high standards.

"To our fans, you’ve had to listen to me bellowing from the other side of the pitch every week but now I want to hear you even louder because I’ll be sitting at home watching the team on the television until my return.

"I know you’ll respect that my health comes first and at this time I’ve got to prioritise what I need to do for me.

"I fully expect to make a full recovery and I look forward to seeing you in the foreseeable future.

"All the best, Your Manager Emma."

Endometriosis is a chronic condition which occurs when tissue from the lining of the womb is found outside of the womb - in areas of the body including the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, the abdomen and the bladder.

Around one-in-ten women are believed to be affected by endometriosis, which can affect fertility.

Emma, who is mum to four-year-old Harry, has spoken previously about her struggles with the condition, describing it as a silent disease, and saying: "I feel the pain, but I refuse to let it take over."

She has also called on the game to do more to recognise the condition, and how players' menstrual cycles and hormonal health can affect performance levels.
